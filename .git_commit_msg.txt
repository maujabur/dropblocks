refactor: cleanup globals and simplify main() - v7.0

Major milestone: dropblocks.cpp reduced from 661 to 314 lines (-52.5%)

Changes:
- Removed unused global variables:
  * PREVIEW_GRID, RAND_TYPE, RAND_BAG_SIZE (now in PieceManager)
  * TICK_MS_START, TICK_MS_MIN (now in GameConfig)
  * parseConfigLine() function (moved to ConfigProcessors)
- Improved documentation of remaining globals:
  * Added clear sections: GLOBAL CONFIGURATION, GAME MECHANICS CONSTANTS
  * Documented that globals are managed by respective systems
  * Added rationale for keeping globals (performance, backward compat)
- Simplified main() function:
  * Removed verbose debug/status output
  * Cleaner initialization flow
  * Uses DebugLogger instead of printf
  * Reduced from 57 to 43 lines (-24.5%)
- Updated version to 7.0:
  * DROPBLOCKS_VERSION: "6.25" -> "7.0"
  * BUILD_INFO: "Major Refactoring Complete"
  * FEATURES: Documents 50% code reduction

Summary of entire refactoring effort:
- dropblocks.cpp: 661 -> 314 lines (-347 lines, -52.5%)
- Created 7 new modules (ConfigApplicator, GameInit, etc.)
- All TODOs completed
- Game compiles and runs correctly

This represents a complete architectural overhaul with significantly
improved modularity, maintainability, and code organization.
